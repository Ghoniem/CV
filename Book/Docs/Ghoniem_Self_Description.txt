Introduction: 
Nasr Ghoniem is internationally renowned as a materials scientist for his seminal scientific contributions. 
His research has included a range of materials science and materials physics problems, exemplified by a 
unique understanding of the role of fundamental materials science in advancing technological innovation.  
He conducted and led research in the areas of damage and failure of materials, defect mechanics and 
physics, material degradation in severe environments, plasma and laser processing, self-organization and 
instability phenomena, and radiation interaction with materials.  Nasr's publication record includes over 
350 publications (280 refereed journal articles), with over 5000 citations (Google Scholar). He edited 
eight books on applied plasma science, multiscale modeling of materials, plasticity & fracture, and nano- 
and micro-mechanics, and is the co-author of a two-volume book (1100 pages) published by Oxford Press 
(2008): Nasr M. Ghoniem and Daniel Walgraef, Instabilities and Self-Organization in Materials, Volume 
I: Fundamentals of Nanoscience, Volume II: Applications in Materials Design and Nanotechnology. The 
first volume lays the mathematical and computational foundations of multiscale modeling methods in 
materials science. The second volume provides the reader with many applications of self-organization 
phenomena in areas as diverse as thin films, crystal growth, radiation effects, surface roughening, 
plasticity, fracture, plasma and laser processing, and nano-particle self-organization. Nasr is well-known 
for his contributions that have shaped the development of material science in recent decades: (1) his 
extensive work on the theory of microstructure evolution in irradiated materials; especially helium 
transport, and helium-vacancy cluster formation, (2) his invention of a class of ferritic/ martensitic steels 
that have the property of "low-activation," with vastly reduced radioactivity levels than prior steels used 
in nuclear applications, (3) his conceptualization of the method of "Dislocation Dynamics," as a viable 
materials science computer simulation tool for investigations of metal plasticity at multi-scales, (4) his 
tireless efforts to work with leaders in the materials science community for the establishment of the field 
of multiscale modeling, which has spurred many recent research activities and captured the imagination 
of many scientists and funding agencies by breaking barriers between traditional disciplines, and (5) his 
research on self-organization and pattern formation phenomena in materials far from equilibrium. 

**Ghoniem's Key Scientific Achievements:**

During his Ph.D. research at the University of Wisconsin, Nasr developed theoretical models for the 
dynamics of point defects and void swelling in structural materials under pulsed irradiation.  His 
theoretical research on the effects of radiation pulsing on materials has defined many of the characteristics 
of microstructure evolution and several macroscopic properties, and his findings were confirmed by 
subsequent experiments.  Prior to Nasr's work, the rate theory of void swelling (and microstructure 
evolution in irradiated materials) has systematically divided the problem into a nucleation phase and a 
growth phase.  However, extension of classical nucleation theory to the clustering of point defects 
produced by irradiation was not successful prior to Nasr's work. Building on his Ph.D. thesis work on the 
formulation of a dynamic rate theory for pulsed systems (e.g. NM Ghoniem, GL Kulcinski, "A critical 
assessment of the effects of pulsed irradiation on the microstructure, swelling, and creep of materials," 
Nucl. Technol./Fusion, 2(2), 165-198, 1982, and NM Ghoniem, "The early stages of void and interstitial 
loop evolution in pulsed fusion reactors," JNM, 89, 359-371,1980), Nasr developed a comprehensive 
framework for the rate theory of microstructure evolution that included both nucleation and growth 
simultaneously, and resulted in direct correlations between theory and experiments (NM Ghoniem, DD 
Cho, "The Simultaneous Clustering of Point Defects during Irradiation," Physica Status Solidi (a) 54 (1), 
171-178, 1979, EP Simonen, NM Ghoniem, NH Packan, "Pulsed flux effects on radiation damage," JNM, 
122 (1-3), 391-401, 1984). He pioneered the development of theoretical and computational methods to 
thoroughly represent components of the microstructure in irradiated materials (e.g. voids, bubbles and 
interstitial clusters/ loops) with hierarchies of rate equations. Nasr's contributions in this area include the 
following:

(1)	Development of the Fokker-Planck stochastic theory of atomic clustering, with several 
applications to microstructure evolution, diffusion of helium in irradiated materials, and has 
generalized the method to study the growth of thin films (e.g.   NM Ghoniem, S Sharafat, "A 
numerical solution to the Fokker-Planck equation describing the evolution of the interstitial loop 
microstructure during irradiation, JNM, 92 (1), 121-135, 1980, NM Ghoniem, "Stochastic theory 
of diffusional planar-atomic clustering and its application to dislocation loops," Physical Review 
B 39 (16), 11810, 1989, and H Huang, NM Ghoniem, "Formulation of a moment method for 
multidimensional Fokker-Planck equations," Physical Review E 51 (6), 5251, 1995).

(2)	Development of the rate theory of helium transport and clustering in irradiated materials, with 
numerous applications to grain boundary fracture and swelling of irradiated materials, and in 
investigations of thermal and irradiation creep (e.g. NM Ghoniem, S Sharafat, JM Williams, and 
LK Mansur, "Theory of helium transport and clustering in materials under irradiation," JNM, 
117, 96-105, 1982, NM Ghoniem, ML Takata, "A rate theory of swelling induced by helium and 
displacement damage in fusion reactor structural materials," JNM 105 (2-3), 276-292, 1982, and 
NM Ghoniem, JN Alhajji, D Kaletta, "The effect of helium clustering on its transport to grain 
boundaries, JNM 136 (2), 192-206, 1985).

With his former students, Nasr developed some of the earliest works in atomistic simulations of radiation 
interaction with materials. He developed Monte Carlo (MC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations 
of radiation interaction with materials.  The computer program that he developed with his former student 
Phillip Chou (Transport of Ions in Polyatomic Materials, TRIPOS) preceded the commercially popular 
code TRIM, routinely used nowadays for ion implantation studies (P Chou, NM Ghoniem, "Precipitate 
dissolution by high energy collision cascades," JNM, 117, 55-63,1983).  His work on atomistic 
simulation of radiation interaction with materials has two salient achievements:
(1)	Ion implantation and preferential sputtering in heterogeneous materials (PS Chou, NM Ghoniem, 
"Applications of the Monte Carlo code TRIPOS to surface and bulk ion transport problems," 
Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, 28 (2), 175-184, 1987, and SP Chou, NM 
Ghoniem, "Molecular dynamics of collision cascades with composite pair--many-body 
potentials," Physical Review, B, 43 (4), 2490-2495, 1991);
(2)	Effects of cosmic radiation on microelectronic materials (MOS microchips). The problem of 
"Single-Event Upset," where single, highly energetic cosmic particles, caused loss of guidance 
and control in early satellites and other spacecraft.  His work with his former student, Roger 
Martin, and industrial collaborators, has paved the way to develop mitigation strategies for this 
problem (e.g. RC Martin, NM Ghoniem "Monte Carlo Simulation of Coupled Ion-Electron 
Transport in Semiconductors," Physica Status Solidi (a) 104 (2), 743-754, 1987, Martin, R. C., 
Ghoniem, N. M., Song, Y., Cable, J. S., "The Size Effect of Ion Charge Tracks on Single Event 
Multiple-Bit Upset," Nuclear Science, IEEE Transactions, 34 (6), 1305- 1309, 1987.  Vu, K.N., 
Cable, J.S., Witteles, A.A., Kolasinski, W.A., Koga, R., Elder, J.H.; Osborn, J.V., Martin, R.C., 
and Ghoniem, N.M., "Experimental and analytical investigation of single event, multiple bit 
upsets in poly-silicon load, 64 Kï¿½1 NMOS SRAMs," Nuclear Science, IEEE Transactions, 35 
(6), 1673-1677, 1988).

Early in his career, and because of his keen understanding of the connection between fundamental 
materials science research and technological innovations, Nasr was the first to recognize the importance 
of environmentally friendly structural materials, where he ventured into the experimental development of 
low-activation steels.  He holds the first world patent on the development of low activation 
ferritic/martensitic steels for (U.S. Patent No. 4,622,067, November 11, 1986 (with D. S. Gelles and R. 
W. Powell).  These early experimental efforts by Nasr have paved the way for worldwide research 
programs to develop structural steel alloys for fission and fusion energy applications that are 
environmentally-friendly, yet of superior high-temperature performance.  His interest in the applied side 
of materials science has led to a widely cited co-authored publication (with Zinkle, 120 citations) that has 
helped guide the selection and development of high-temperature structural materials in nuclear energy 
applications (SJ Zinkle, NM Ghoniem, "Operating temperature windows for fusion reactor structural 
materials," Fusion Engineering and Design 51, 55-71, 2000).

Nasr recognized the importance of silicon carbide as a high-temperature material that has vast potential in 
the electronics and nuclear industries.  He mentored several Ph.D. students and guided them to work on 
fundamental aspects of defects, and on swelling and fracture processes in SiC and SiC/SiC composites.  
The two students whom he mentored in this area are currently chaired professor at UConn (Huang) and 
full professor at Purdue (El Azab).  The basic determination of point defect formation and migration 
energies in SiC was laid out by Nasr and his group (H Huang, NM Ghoniem, JK Wong, M Baskes, 
"Molecular dynamics determination of defect energetics in beta-SiC using three representative empirical 
potentials," Modell. & Sim. in Mat. Sci. & Eng. 3, 615, 1995 - 85 citations, H Huang, N Ghoniem, "A 
swelling model for stoichiometric SiC at temperatures below 1000 OC under neutron irradiation," JNM, 
250 (2-3), 192-199, 1997; H Hanchen, N Ghoniem, "Neutron displacement damage cross sections for 
SiC, JNM, 199 (3), 221-230, 1993, and El-Azab, A.; Ghoniem, M., "Viscoelastic analysis of mismatch 
stresses in ceramic matrix composites under high-temperature neutron irradiation," Mech. of Mat., 20 (4), 
291-303, 1995.)

Nasr established a very productive experimental and modeling research program on plasma processing of 
materials at UCLA in the 1990's.  He collaborated with some of the leading Japanese scientists on 
establishing a successful series of international conferences on Applied Plasma Science.  Together with 
Kobayashi (Osaka University), they established and maintained a bi-annual conference on applications of 
plasmas in materials science and produced several conference proceeding (Akira Kobayashi and Nasr M. 
Ghoniem, co-editors, "Advances in Applied Plasma Science, Vol. I" Proc. of the 1st Int. Symp. on Appl. 
Plasma Science, 22-26 Sept. 1997, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA., USA, 198 pages, and  Vol. II" Proc. of the 
2nd Int. Symp. on Appl. Plasma Science, 20-24 Sept. 1999, Osaka Sun Palace, Osaka, Japan, 453 pages).  
Since he and Kobayashi started the series at UCLA in 1997, the bi-annual event is continuing the 
contribution to the science of materials processed by plasmas and ions.  Nasr and his former students have 
contributed significantly to the specific area of plasma spray of micro-structured high-temperature 
coatings in a series of experimental and theoretical papers (e.g. S Sharafat, A Kobayashi, Y Chen, NM 
Ghoniem, "Plasma spraying of micro-composite thermal barrier coatings," Vacuum 65 (3-4), 415-425, 
2002; 	A Kobayashi, S Sharafat, NM Ghoniem, "Formation of tungsten coatings by gas tunnel type 
plasma spraying," Surface and Coatings Technology 200 (14), 4630-4635, 2000; MD Demetriou, NM 
Ghoniem, A S Lavine, "Kinetic modeling of phase selection during non-equilibrium solidification of a 
tungsten-carbon system,"
Acta Materialia, 50 (6), 1421-1432, 2002.)

An important characteristic of Nasr's research is his ability to transfer knowledge from neighboring fields 
and thus enrich the science of materials.  He had a significant collaboration with leading theoreticians in 
Europe and South America to establish methodologies of non-linear dynamics in the materials science 
field.  The success of the mathematical methods of non-linear dynamics in understanding pattern 
selection, stability and bifurcations in fluid and chemical systems led Nasr to establish a decades-long 
collaboration with Daniel Walgraef.  Together, they tackled several self-organization and pattern 
formation phenomena in non-equilibrium materials (e.g. D Walgraef, J Lauzeral, NM Ghoniem, "Theory 
and numerical simulations of defect ordering in irradiated materials," Physical Review B, 53 (22), 
14782,1996, J Lauzeral, D Walgraef, NM Ghoniem, "Rose Deformation Patterns in Thin Films Irradiated 
by Focused Laser Beams," Phy. Rev. lett. 79 (14), 2706-2709, 1997; D Walgraef, NM Ghoniem, 
"Nonlinear dynamics of self-organized microstructure under irradiation," Physical Review B 52 (6), 3951, 
1995).  Their collaboration resulted in the systematic exposition of the subject of self-organization of 
materials in a rigorous framework that was published in a two-volume book by Oxford Press in 2008.

Around 1987-1988, Nasr pioneered the development of a ground-breaking computational method, known 
now as "Dislocation Dynamics," for the simulation of the collective dynamics of three-dimensional line 
defects (dislocations) that are the fundamental carriers of plastic flow in materials (N.M. Ghoniem, R.J. 
Amodeo, "Computer Simulation of Dislocation Pattern Formation," in Non-Linear Phenomena in 
Materials Science I, L. Kubin and G. Martin, Eds., 377-388, 1988, RJ Amodeo and NM Ghoniem, 
"Dislocation dynamics. I: A proposed methodology for deformation micromechanics," Physical Review B 
41 (10), 6958, 1990, "Dislocation dynamics. II: Applications to the formation of persistent slip bands, 
planar arrays, and dislocation cells," Physical Review B 41 (10), 6968, 1990. His research has led to 
worldwide (and continuing) efforts to establish a physical theory of plasticity and fracture of materials, 
with significant implications in the design of advanced materials. Prior to this work, the mechanical 
properties were derived from the behavior of single dislocations in empirically conceptualized models.  
His early fundamental contributions in this area have led to the emergence of an elegant and rigorous 
computational method for simulation of plastic flow and fracture, as well as understanding of basic 
dislocation properties (e.g. NM Ghoniem, SH Tong, LZ Sun, "Parametric dislocation dynamics: a 
thermodynamics-based approach to investigations of mesoscopic plastic deformation," Physical Review 
B, 61 (2), 913, 2000; NM Ghoniem, LZ Sun, "Fast-sum method for the elastic field of three-dimensional 
dislocation ensembles," Physical review B 60 (1), 128, 1999."  As a result of advances in material 
characterization techniques, and the miniaturization of sample geometry, direct experimental comparisons 
between computer simulations and experiment have lent great credence to the fidelity of the dislocation 
dynamics method as a reliable tool to investigate the mechanical behavior and to rationalize experimental 
observations on a physical basis (e.g. JA El-Awady, M Wen, NM Ghoniem, "The role of the weakest-link 
mechanism in controlling the plasticity of micropillars," J. of the Mech. & Phys. Sol.,  57 (1), 32-50, 
2009.)

**Materials Science Contributions and Service:**

Nasr Ghoniem has made numerous and important, long-term contributions to the Materials Research 
Society. He has been an active member and participant in MRS activities for two decades. Through his 
participation in MRS activities, he worked with a number of scientists to establish the field of "Multiscale 
Modeling of Materials." The first step taken was through an MRS Symposium (Bulatov, T. Diaz de la 
Rubia, R. Phillips, E. Kaxiras, and N. M. Ghoniem, Co-editors, "Multiscale Modeling of Materials," 
Proc. of the 1998 MRS Soc. Symp., 538, 1999, 591 pages).  A highly cited general reference for this effort 
was published by Phil Mag: NM Ghoniem, EP Busso, N Kioussis, H Huang, "Multiscale modelling of 
nanomechanics and micromechanics: an overview," Philosophical Magazine, 83 (31-34), 3475-3528,
