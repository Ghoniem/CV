    "During his distinguished career at UCLA, Professor Nasr Ghoniem mentored 45 Ph.D. students, eight of whom became professors, while the others assumed prominent roles in national laboratories and industry. He also guided 80 Master's students and supervised more than 38 postdoctoral researchers and professional staff from diverse global backgrounds. Notably, eight of his former postdoctoral scholars have also become professors, bringing the total number of professors mentored by him to 16. Professor Ghoniem's educational and mentoring influence extends across the United States and internationally, particularly in the fields of radiation-material interactions, and the mechanics and physics of defects. His former students have made groundbreaking contributions to nuclear and aerospace engineering, materials science, and mechanics of materials, reflecting his dedicated mentorship and guidance.\r\n",
