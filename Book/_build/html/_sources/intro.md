<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: 14px;">Welcome to Professor Ghoniem's web page! Born in Alexandria, Egypt, I immigrated to the United States in 1974. I earned my Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1977 and began my academic career as an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, the same year. After retiring from teaching and administrative roles in 2020, I continue to engage in research as an emeritus professor at UCLA. Additionally, I serve as the CEO of my company, Digital Materials Solutions, Inc. (DMS), where I provide consulting services.</span>
