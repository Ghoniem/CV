    "Nasrâ€™s publication record includes over 450 publications (380 refereed journal articles), with over 12,000 citations (Google Scholar). He edited eight books on applied plasma science, multiscale modeling of materials, plasticity & fracture, and nano- and micro-mechanics, and is the co-author of a two-volume book (1100 pages) published by Oxford Press (2008): Nasr M. Ghoniem and Daniel Walgraef, Instabilities and Self-Organization in Materials, Volume I: Fundamentals of Nanoscience, Volume II: Applications in Materials Design and Nanotechnology. The first volume lays the mathematical and computational foundations of multiscale modeling methods in materials science. The second volume provides the reader with many applications of self-organization phenomena in areas as diverse as thin films, crystal growth, radiation effects, surface roughening, plasticity, fracture, plasma and laser processing, and nano-particle self-organization. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "He was the general chair of the Second International Multiscale Materials Modeling Conference in 2004 and the chair of the 19$^{th}$ International Conference on Fusion Reactor Materials in 2019. He serves on the editorial boards of several journals and has published over 350 articles, 10 edited books, and is the co-author of a two-volume book (Oxford Press) on the mechanics and physics of defects, computational materials science, radiation interaction with materials, instabilities,\r\n",
