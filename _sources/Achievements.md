<strong>[1]</strong> During his Ph.D. research at the University of Wisconsin, Nasr developed theoretical models for the 
dynamics of point defects and void swelling in structural materials under pulsed irradiation.  His 
theoretical research on the effects of radiation pulsing on materials has defined many of the characteristics 
of microstructure evolution and several macroscopic properties, and his findings were confirmed by 
subsequent experiments.  Building on his Ph.D. thesis work on the  formulation of a dynamic rate theory for pulsed systems (e.g. NM Ghoniem, GL Kulcinski, "A critical 
assessment of the effects of pulsed irradiation on the microstructure, swelling, and creep of materials," 
Nucl. Technol./Fusion, 2(2), 165-198, 1982, Nasr developed a comprehensive 
framework for the rate theory of microstructure evolution that included both nucleation and growth 
simultaneously, and resulted in direct correlations between theory and experiments (NM Ghoniem, DD 
Cho, "The Simultaneous Clustering of Point Defects during Irradiation," Physica Status Solidi (a) 54 (1), 
171-178, 1979, EP Simonen, NM Ghoniem, NH Packan, "Pulsed flux effects on radiation damage," JNM, 
122 (1-3), 391-401, 1984).

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<strong>[2]</strong> Development of the Fokker-Planck theory of atomic clustering, with several 
applications to microstructure evolution, diffusion of helium in irradiated materials, and the growth of thin films (e.g.   NM Ghoniem, S Sharafat, "A 
numerical solution to the Fokker-Planck equation describing the evolution of the interstitial loop 
microstructure during irradiation, JNM, 92 (1), 121-135, 1980, NM Ghoniem, "Stochastic theory 
of diffusional planar-atomic clustering and its application to dislocation loops," Physical Review 
B 39 (16), 11810, 1989, and H Huang, NM Ghoniem, "Formulation of a moment method for 
multidimensional Fokker-Planck equations," Physical Review E 51 (6), 5251, 1995).
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<strong>[3]</strong> Development of the rate theory of helium transport and clustering in irradiated materials, with 
numerous applications to grain boundary fracture and swelling of irradiated materials, and in 
investigations of thermal and irradiation creep (e.g. NM Ghoniem, S Sharafat, JM Williams, and 
LK Mansur, "Theory of helium transport and clustering in materials under irradiation," JNM, 
117, 96-105, 1982, NM Ghoniem, ML Takata, "A rate theory of swelling induced by helium and 
displacement damage in fusion reactor structural materials," JNM 105 (2-3), 276-292, 1982, and 
NM Ghoniem, JN Alhajji, D Kaletta, "The effect of helium clustering on its transport to grain 
boundaries, JNM 136 (2), 192-206, 1985).
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<strong>[4]</strong> Development of the earliest investigations into atomistic simulations of radiation 
interaction with materials. He developed Monte Carlo (MC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations 
of radiation interaction with materials.  The computer program that he developed with his former student 
Phillip Chou (Transport of Ions in Polyatomic Materials, TRIPOS) preceded the commercially popular 
code TRIM, routinely used nowadays for ion implantation studies (P Chou, NM Ghoniem, "Precipitate 
dissolution by high energy collision cascades," JNM, 117, 55-63,1983).  His work on atomistic 
simulation of radiation interaction with materials has two salient achievements:
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    (1)	Ion implantation and preferential sputtering in heterogeneous materials (PS Chou, NM Ghoniem, 
"Applications of the Monte Carlo code TRIPOS to surface and bulk ion transport problems," 
Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, 28 (2), 175-184, 1987, and SP Chou, NM 
Ghoniem, "Molecular dynamics of collision cascades with composite pair--many-body 
potentials," Physical Review, B, 43 (4), 2490-2495, 1991);
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    (2)	Effects of cosmic radiation on microelectronic materials (MOS microchips). The problem of 
"Single-Event Upset," where single, highly energetic cosmic particles, caused loss of guidance 
and control in early satellites and other spacecraft.  His work with his former student, Roger 
Martin, and industrial collaborators, has paved the way to develop mitigation strategies for this 
problem (e.g. RC Martin, NM Ghoniem "Monte Carlo Simulation of Coupled Ion-Electron 
Transport in Semiconductors," Physica Status Solidi (a) 104 (2), 743-754, 1987, Martin, R. C., 
Ghoniem, N. M., Song, Y., Cable, J. S., "The Size Effect of Ion Charge Tracks on Single Event 
Multiple-Bit Upset," Nuclear Science, IEEE Transactions, 34 (6), 1305- 1309, 1987.  Vu, K.N., 
Cable, J.S., Witteles, A.A., Kolasinski, W.A., Koga, R., Elder, J.H.; Osborn, J.V., Martin, R.C., 
and Ghoniem, N.M., "Experimental and analytical investigation of single event, multiple bit 
upsets in poly-silicon load, 64K NMOS SRAMs," Nuclear Science, IEEE Transactions, 35 
(6), 1673-1677, 1988).

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<strong>[5]</strong> The first world patent on the development of low activation 
ferritic/martensitic steels for (U.S. Patent No. 4,622,067, November 11, 1986 (with D. S. Gelles and R. 
W. Powell) [Ghoniem Patenet](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/866049).  These early experimental efforts by Nasr have paved the way for worldwide research 
programs to develop structural steel alloys for fission and fusion energy applications that are 
environmentally-friendly, yet of superior high-temperature performance.  His interest in the applied side 
of materials science has led to a widely cited co-authored publication (with Zinkle, 120 citations) that has 
helped guide the selection and development of high-temperature structural materials in nuclear energy 
applications (SJ Zinkle, NM Ghoniem, "Operating temperature windows for fusion reactor structural 
materials," Fusion Engineering and Design 51, 55-71, 2000).
</div>


<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<strong>[6]</strong> Research on silicon carbide as a high-temperature material that has vast potential in 
the electronics and nuclear industries.  He mentored several Ph.D. students and guided them to work on 
fundamental aspects of defects, and on swelling and fracture processes in SiC and SiC/SiC composites.  
The two students whom he mentored in this area are currently chaired professor at UConn (Huang) and 
full professor at Purdue (El Azab).  The basic determination of point defect formation and migration 
energies in SiC was laid out by Nasr and his group (H Huang, NM Ghoniem, JK Wong, M Baskes, 
"Molecular dynamics determination of defect energetics in beta-SiC using three representative empirical 
potentials," Modell. & Sim. in Mat. Sci. & Eng. 3, 615, 1995 - 85 citations, H Huang, N Ghoniem, "A 
swelling model for stoichiometric SiC at temperatures below 1000 OC under neutron irradiation," JNM, 
250 (2-3), 192-199, 1997; H Hanchen, N Ghoniem, "Neutron displacement damage cross sections for 
SiC, JNM, 199 (3), 221-230, 1993, and El-Azab, A.; Ghoniem, M., "Viscoelastic analysis of mismatch 
stresses in ceramic matrix composites under high-temperature neutron irradiation," Mech. of Mat., 20 (4), 
291-303, 1995.)
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<strong>[7]</strong> He established a very productive experimental and modeling research program on plasma processing of 
materials at UCLA in the 1990's.  He collaborated with some of the leading Japanese scientists on 
establishing a successful series of international conferences on Applied Plasma Science.  Together with 
Kobayashi (Osaka University), they established and maintained a bi-annual conference on applications of 
plasmas in materials science and produced several conference proceeding (Akira Kobayashi and Nasr M. 
Ghoniem, co-editors, "Advances in Applied Plasma Science, Vol. I" Proc. of the 1st Int. Symp. on Appl. 
Plasma Science, 22-26 Sept. 1997, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA., USA, 198 pages, and  Vol. II" Proc. of the 
2nd Int. Symp. on Appl. Plasma Science, 20-24 Sept. 1999, Osaka Sun Palace, Osaka, Japan, 453 pages).  
Since he and Kobayashi started the series at UCLA in 1997, the bi-annual event is continuing the 
contribution to the science of materials processed by plasmas and ions.  Nasr and his former students have 
contributed significantly to the specific area of plasma spray of micro-structured high-temperature 
coatings in a series of experimental and theoretical papers (e.g. S Sharafat, A Kobayashi, Y Chen, NM 
Ghoniem, "Plasma spraying of micro-composite thermal barrier coatings," Vacuum 65 (3-4), 415-425, 
2002; 	A Kobayashi, S Sharafat, NM Ghoniem, "Formation of tungsten coatings by gas tunnel type 
plasma spraying," Surface and Coatings Technology 200 (14), 4630-4635, 2000; MD Demetriou, NM 
Ghoniem, A S Lavine, "Kinetic modeling of phase selection during non-equilibrium solidification of a 
tungsten-carbon system,"
Acta Materialia, 50 (6), 1421-1432, 2002.)
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<strong>[8]</strong>   He had a significant collaboration with leading theoreticians in 
Europe and South America to establish methodologies of non-linear dynamics in the materials science 
field.  The success of the mathematical methods of non-linear dynamics in understanding pattern 
selection, stability and bifurcations in fluid and chemical systems led Nasr to establish a decades-long 
collaboration with Daniel Walgraef.  Together, they tackled several self-organization and pattern 
formation phenomena in non-equilibrium materials (e.g. D Walgraef, J Lauzeral, NM Ghoniem, "Theory 
and numerical simulations of defect ordering in irradiated materials," Physical Review B, 53 (22), 
14782,1996, J Lauzeral, D Walgraef, NM Ghoniem, "Rose Deformation Patterns in Thin Films Irradiated 
by Focused Laser Beams," Phy. Rev. lett. 79 (14), 2706-2709, 1997; D Walgraef, NM Ghoniem, 
"Nonlinear dynamics of self-organized microstructure under irradiation," Physical Review B 52 (6), 3951, 
1995).  Their collaboration resulted in the systematic exposition of the subject of self-organization of 
materials in a rigorous framework that was published in a two-volume book by Oxford Press in 2008.

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<strong>[9]</strong> In 1987, he pioneered the development of a ground-breaking computational method, known 
now as "Dislocation Dynamics," for the simulation of the collective dynamics of three-dimensional line 
defects (dislocations) that are the fundamental carriers of plastic flow in materials (N.M. Ghoniem, R.J. 
Amodeo, "Computer Simulation of Dislocation Pattern Formation," in Non-Linear Phenomena in 
Materials Science I, L. Kubin and G. Martin, Eds., 377-388, 1988, RJ Amodeo and NM Ghoniem, 
"Dislocation dynamics. I: A proposed methodology for deformation micromechanics," Physical Review B 
41 (10), 6958, 1990, "Dislocation dynamics. II: Applications to the formation of persistent slip bands, 
planar arrays, and dislocation cells," Physical Review B 41 (10), 6968, 1990. His research has led to 
worldwide (and continuing) efforts to establish a physical theory of plasticity and fracture of materials, 
with significant implications in the design of advanced materials. Prior to this work, the mechanical 
properties were derived from the behavior of single dislocations in empirically conceptualized models.  
His early fundamental contributions in this area have led to the emergence of an elegant and rigorous 
computational method for simulation of plastic flow and fracture, as well as understanding of basic 
dislocation properties (e.g. NM Ghoniem, SH Tong, LZ Sun, "Parametric dislocation dynamics: a 
thermodynamics-based approach to investigations of mesoscopic plastic deformation," Physical Review 
B, 61 (2), 913, 2000; NM Ghoniem, LZ Sun, "Fast-sum method for the elastic field of three-dimensional 
dislocation ensembles," Physical review B 60 (1), 128, 1999."  As a result of advances in material 
characterization techniques, and the miniaturization of sample geometry, direct experimental comparisons 
between computer simulations and experiment have lent great credence to the fidelity of the dislocation 
dynamics method as a reliable tool to investigate the mechanical behavior and to rationalize experimental 
observations on a physical basis (e.g. JA El-Awady, M Wen, NM Ghoniem, "The role of the weakest-link 
mechanism in controlling the plasticity of micropillars," J. of the Mech. & Phys. Sol.,  57 (1), 32-50, 
2009.)
